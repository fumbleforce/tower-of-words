# Places

Day 1 has four places: the monorail (`train`), the head office lobby with the gate (`gate`), the lift (`lift`) and IT support on B2 (`office`). For each: its things and their labels, spots, seats, zones, who is there in each period, and its small moments; also places decided but not built, and how you get between places. Last checked against the game on 2026-09-29.

Elsewhere: the island as a whole is in [setting.md](setting.md); the people in [cast.md](cast.md); what happens in a place as part of a storyline is in [stories/](stories/); how places look (palette, light, style) in [art-and-sound.md](art-and-sound.md). The hooks a story can call in each place (doors, the gate, the copier) are in game3d/story/FORMAT.md.

The tables are checked by `node tools/facts/check.mjs`: things and their labels, spots, seats, zones, who has a body in each place and the story's schedule for them, and the small-moment nodes. Coordinates: x runs left to right on screen, z from the back (negative) toward the camera; a unit is about a metre and a half.

## Places decided but not built

The company city has dorms, a canteen, shops, a bar and a university ([setting.md](setting.md)); none are built. Eric's dorm room is described in [cast.md](cast.md) (to build). Only the places below exist.

## Getting between places

There are no cuts to black (Jørgen, 2026-09-28: "elegant, continuous transitions"). Each move is one trip the player watches:

- Monorail to lobby: Eric steps off onto the platform, walks along it to the covered walkway and in through the lobby's glass doors.
- Lobby to B2: the lift. It is a small lit room he walks into, and the camera stays inside the car for the whole ride (Jørgen: "You should always be seeing your character. Ideally you'd have the elevator as a room in the lobby you go into."). The floor display counts from 1; someone has pressed 5, where the two from Sales get out; then down to B2. The doors open on the B2 lift landing.

The dialogue slots for each trip are in game3d/story/transitions.js (format: FORMAT.md, Transitions).

## Monorail (`train`)

One car of the monorail, crossing the bay from the mainland to Honsha station. The camera looks at it from the platform side, with the near wall cut away for the play camera only. The car is about 8 long and 2.4 wide, with benches along both sides, full-height sliding doors at the near-side corners (they stay full height in the cutaway too, so they never change size while Eric walks out or the car pulls away; Jørgen: "the doors are still half size when trying to leave the train wagon, then magically transform to full height as the train leaves"; they finish shutting before the car moves) and closed neighbour cars (Jørgen, on the title shot: "the doors are hobbit sized, and the carriage behind looks like it is some sort of pavilion"). Sea on both sides out of the windows. When it stops, the station sign and the platform are outside the doors. The train was built earlier (legacy/side/train/) and may be changed where needed.

`seat_aoi`, `seat_far_r` (the free seat next to Mio), `seat_near_l`, `seat_near_r`, `seat_mio`

### Zones

`door_zone` (either door, while open), `free_seat` (standing at the free seat)

### Who's there when

The monorail has one period, early morning.

| Id | Usually | Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| `mio` | Far bench, right, with her laptop, the free seat beside her. | – |

### Small moments

| Nodes | When | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `window` | Talk to the window | Eric: nobody said the island was this far out. |
| `poster`, `straps`, `rack`, `plant`, `seat_bags` | Talk to them | One line each (see Things). |
| `reader`, `ohayo_reader` | Talk to him, or greet him | The book is called "Excel for People Who Hate Excel"; he nods, still reading. |
| `phone_girl`, `ohayo_aoi` | Talk to Aoi, or greet her | She's on the phone about her assignment ("anywhere but the basement"); a nod. |
| `bun`, `youth`, `music`, `stander` | Talk to them after the first time | A line or an emote each. |
| `ohayo_bun`, `ohayo_youth`, `ohayo_music`, `ohayo_stander` | Greet them | Each answers in their own way. |

The man with a bag (`stander`) has no talk or greeting trigger, so `stander` and `ohayo_stander` never play.

## Head office lobby (`gate`)

The lobby of the head office building at Honsha station, in the muted palette ([art-and-sound.md](art-and-sound.md)). About 12.6 wide and 9 deep, glass entrance doors at the front. A security barrier runs across the middle with two card readers either side of a scanner arch with two glass flaps and a small head-count screen. The guard's desk sits in the barrier line on the right; the visitor counter with the visitor book and a lost-and-found shelf on the left; benches either side; posters and a notice screen on the back wall, where the lift bank is. Office workers walk in, tap through and take the lifts on their own (not tappable); their number follows the story (a jammed gate means a queue, waiting by the readers with their phones out). One of them carries a cake box.

## The lift (`lift`)

A small lit car, the same in the lobby (floor 1) and on B2. The display counts floors: B2, B1, 1 to 5 in the ride. No things of its own; the ride's lines are in the [`emi-budget`](stories/emi-budget.md) storyline.

## IT support, B2 (`office`)

The second basement of head office: IT support. One compact floor, close to square with no empty gaps, planned from the B2 pixel mockup (art/pixel/island/b2/mockup2-full-1x.png; Jørgen: "not bad"), not from 3-office.png's plan, which was "kind of nonsensical". Top row, left to right: the lift landing with the stairwell behind it and a vending machine; the main office (企画室) with one island of six steel desks and the section chief's desk across its head; the machine room (機械室) with the server racks, behind a door with a card reader. A corridor runs across the middle, with the fire exit at its right end. Bottom row: the copy room (コピー室), the kitchenette (給湯室, its door facing the office door, with a tray of seven cups, three of them dusty), then the men's and women's toilets. Door plates B2 and 企画室７. Near walls are cut away for the play camera.
