# Places

Day 1 has four places: the monorail (`train`), Honsha station’s security room with the gate (`gate`), the lift (`lift`) and IT support on B2 (`office`). For each: its things and their labels, spots, seats, zones, who is there in each period, and its small moments; also places decided but not built, and how you get between places. Last checked against the game on 2026-09-29.

Elsewhere: the island as a whole is in [setting.md](setting.md); the people in [cast.md](cast.md); what happens in a place as part of a storyline is in [stories/](stories/); how places look (palette, light, style) in [art-and-sound.md](art-and-sound.md). The hooks a story can call in each place (doors, the gate, the copier) are in game3d/story/FORMAT.md.

The tables are checked by `node tools/facts/check.mjs`: things and their labels, spots, seats, zones, who has a body in each place and the story's schedule for them, and the small-moment nodes. Coordinates: x runs left to right on screen, z from the back (negative) toward the camera; a unit is about a metre and a half.

## Places decided but not built

The company city has dorms, a canteen, shops, a bar and a university ([setting.md](setting.md)); only the places in the list below are planned, and only the `##` sections further down are built. One line per planned place: name, id, what it is.

- The outdoor paths (`path`): the short walk from Honsha station's security room to the separate head office building, and the connected walk from head office to the dorms. The station gate location is decided (reviews/gate-location, 2026-09-29); the full island layout comes first, in map round 4, following Jørgen's rejection of dorm-b. Keep the paths continuous and legible on that map before building either trip. Things proposed for the day-1 slice: station exit, head office entrance, fountain edge, bicycle shelter, planted verge and dorm entrance. Proposed spots: `station_exit`, `office_exit`, `fountain_edge`, `dorm_approach`. Shops and other island places can remain background buildings; no full island simulation is requested. [dorm-route-1](../../reviews/dorm-route-1/review.json) preserves the earlier options and feedback, with no layout picked.
- The dorms (`dorms`): the dorm building from outside, and Eric's room, described in [cast.md](cast.md) (Eric, Home). Proposed for layout review: a pale concrete apartment block with a sheltered entry and mailboxes; a short ground-floor passage reaches the room. Things: entrance, mailboxes, room door, bed, desk, delivered boxes and window. Proposed spots: `entrance`, `corridor_turn`, `room_entry`, `window_front`. A clear aisle connects the entry to the window, with bed and desk against opposite walls. The neighbouring building's blank end wall supplies the decided outlook. The compact entry strip can contain a kitchenette and a closed bathroom door. These fittings and the ground-floor position are proposals, not additional decided room facts.

## Getting between places

There are no cuts to black (Jørgen, 2026-09-28: "elegant, continuous transitions"). Each move is one trip the player watches. One line per trip: from, to, how, then what the player sees; a trip to or from a planned place is planned too. The bible draws these as the places diagram (http://127.0.0.1:8771/bible/#place-map).

- `train` → `gate`, walk: Eric steps off onto the platform, walks along it to the covered walkway and enters Honsha station's security room through its glass doors.
- `gate` → `lift`, walk: the current runtime goes straight from the gate room into its attached lift. This direct trip is to be replaced by the planned outdoor walk below; the lift belongs in the separate head office building after the map is picked.
- `lift` → `office`, lift: the camera stays inside the car for the whole ride (Jørgen: "You should always be seeing your character."). The floor display counts from 1; someone has pressed 5, where the two from Sales get out; then down to B2. The doors open on the B2 lift landing.
- `office` → `lift`, walk: planned return from the B2 landing into the existing lift after work; Eric stays visible through the doors.
- `lift` → `path`, lift then walk: planned return ride to head office floor 1, keeping the camera inside the car until its doors open; Eric then leaves through the head office entrance onto the same outdoor paths.
- `gate` → `path`, walk: planned exit from the station security room onto the outdoor link to head office. The camera follows Eric outside without a black cut.
- `path` → `lift`, walk: planned approach to the separate head office entrance, then through its small lobby to the B2 lift. The station and head office entrances must both be visible on the picked map.
- `path` → `dorms`, walk: planned walk from head office to the dorm entrance and through a short passage into Eric’s room, with the route awaiting the full island map pick. Keep him visible across both thresholds; camera movement and near-wall removal reveal the interior. No new dialogue is implemented.

The dialogue slots for each trip are in game3d/story/transitions.js (format: FORMAT.md, Transitions).

## Monorail (`train`)

One car of the monorail, crossing the bay from the mainland to Honsha station. The camera looks at it from the platform side, with the near wall cut away for the play camera only. The car is about 8 long and 2.4 wide, with benches along both sides, full-height sliding doors at the near-side corners (they stay full height in the cutaway too, so they never change size while Eric walks out or the car pulls away; Jørgen: "the doors are still half size when trying to leave the train wagon, then magically transform to full height as the train leaves"; they finish shutting before the car moves) and closed neighbour cars (Jørgen, on the title shot: "the doors are hobbit sized, and the carriage behind looks like it is some sort of pavilion"). Sea on both sides out of the windows. When it stops, the station sign and the platform are outside the doors. The train was built earlier (legacy/side/train/) and may be changed where needed.

### Things

| Id | Label | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `doors` | Doors | Both door pairs, while they're open. |
| `door_l` | Doors | The left door pair. |
| `door_r` | Doors | The right door pair. |
| `foodbag` | Her lunch bag | Mio's bag of her mother's pickles, on the free seat beside her. Can be caught when it slides. |
| `cup` | Coffee | A lidded coffee on the free seat, hidden (left from when the seat was Rei's). |
| `bags` | Bags | Bags on every seat but one. |
| `rack` | Luggage rack | Suitcases, all with the same Amakawa luggage tag. |
| `straps` | Straps | Hanging straps. |
| `window` | Window | Sea on both sides. |
| `poster` | Poster | A katakana poster with a smiling cartoon monorail. |
| `plant` | Plant | Plastic, and someone waters it anyway. |
| `sign` | Station sign | Outside, once the train has stopped. |
| `platform` | Platform | Outside the doors. |

### Spots

`aisle`, `door_l`, `door_r`, `by_aoi`, `by_kuroda`, `platform`, `walkway`, `plat_l`, `plat_l2`, `plat_hamada`

### Seats

`seat_aoi`, `seat_far_r` (the free seat next to Mio), `seat_near_l`, `seat_near_r`, `seat_mio`

### Zones

`door_zone` (either door, while open), `free_seat` (standing at the free seat)

### Who's there when

The monorail has one period, early morning.

| Id | Usually | Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| `mio` | Far bench, right, with her laptop, the free seat beside her. | – |
| `aoi` | Far bench, left, on the phone. | – |
| `kuroda` | Far bench, far left, asleep. | – |
| `reader` | Far bench, reading. | – |
| `music` | Near bench, cap and headphones, nodding. | – |
| `bun` | Near bench, left, seen from behind. | – |
| `youth` | Near bench, right, seen from behind. | – |
| `stander` | Hidden following the rejected silhouette. | – |
| `tama` | Far bench, washing. | – |
| `rei` | Hidden (her seat is Mio's now). | – |

### Small moments

| Nodes | When | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `window` | Talk to the window | Eric: nobody said the island was this far out. |
| `poster`, `straps`, `rack`, `plant`, `seat_bags` | Talk to them | One line each (see Things). |
| `reader`, `ohayo_reader` | Talk to him, or greet him | The book is called "Excel for People Who Hate Excel"; he nods, still reading. |
| `phone_girl`, `ohayo_aoi` | Talk to Aoi, or greet her | She's on the phone about her assignment ("anywhere but the basement"); a nod. |
| `bun`, `youth`, `music`, `stander` | Talk to them after the first time | A line or an emote each. |
| `ohayo_bun`, `ohayo_youth`, `ohayo_music`, `ohayo_stander` | Greet them | Each answers in their own way. |

The man with a bag (`stander`) is hidden following the silhouette rejection, and has no talk or greeting trigger, so `stander` and `ohayo_stander` never play. The six scenery nodes above exist in the script but are disabled by the current marker rules; the passengers are reachable.

Planned passenger revisions, awaiting [train-discoveries-1](../../reviews/train-discoveries-1/review.json): give Aoi a brief awkward exchange when she realises Eric is assigned to the basement she has just dismissed; let the woman with the bun enlist Eric to close an overfilled shopping bag; show the young man's pride in his first goal despite his team's loss; let the girl with headphones show her own guitar practice; let the reader show the mismatch between his Excel book and the company's old software; and show Hamada silencing a reminder without waking properly. Each moment starts with one interaction, including on first contact before the seat hint. They are optional, need no menu or quiz, and add no later quest. Proposed passenger speech has English subtitles for the player, including unfamiliar Japanese; Eric still follows familiar words and gestures. Mio's conversation and Tama's existing moments stay as they are. Exact proposed passages and their visual staging live only in the review; no new dialogue, prop or voice is built yet.

## Honsha station security room (`gate`)

Honsha station's security room, in the muted palette ([art-and-sound.md](art-and-sound.md)). About 12.6 wide and 9 deep, glass entrance doors at the front. A security barrier runs across the middle with two card readers either side of a scanner arch with two glass flaps and a small head-count screen. The guard's desk sits in the barrier line on the right; the visitor counter with the visitor book and a lost-and-found shelf on the left; benches either side; posters and a notice screen on the back wall, where the lift bank is. Office workers walk in, tap through and take the lifts on their own (not tappable); their number follows the story (a jammed gate means a queue, waiting by the readers with their phones out). One of them carries a cake box.

The gate stays in this room, as Jørgen picked in [gate-location](../../reviews/gate-location/review.json). Its geometry stays as built. The direct lift attachment is still the current runtime; the decided plan replaces that exit with a walk outside to the separate head office building. That move waits for the full island map pick. No new gate dialogue or extra security stop is proposed.

## The lift (`lift`)

A small lit car, the same in the lobby (floor 1) and on B2. The display counts floors: B2, B1, 1 to 5 in the ride. No things of its own; the ride's lines are in the [`emi-budget`](stories/emi-budget.md) storyline.

## IT support, B2 (`office`)

The second basement of head office: IT support. One compact floor, close to square with no empty gaps, planned from the B2 pixel mockup (art/pixel/island/b2/mockup2-full-1x.png; Jørgen: "not bad"), not from 3-office.png's plan, which was "kind of nonsensical". Top row, left to right: the lift landing with the stairwell behind it and a vending machine; the main office (企画室) with one island of six steel desks and the section chief's desk across its head; the machine room (機械室) with the server racks, behind a door with a card reader. A corridor runs across the middle, with the fire exit at its right end. Bottom row: the copy room (コピー室), the kitchenette (給湯室, its door facing the office door, with a tray of seven cups, three of them dusty), then the men's and women's toilets. Door plates B2 and 企画室７. Near walls are cut away for the play camera.
